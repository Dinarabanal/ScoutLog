Scout Log in its inital phase is to help the Scout master keep track of the scouts and their badges. It allows an interactive 
use of an app. Badges are easy to identify by their look as well as their name. Scouts and their ranking are avaiable to review
as well as addinig new scouts.

Future implimentation includes allowing the badge to be assigned to a scout. Also adding requirements to each badge. 
As irt expands, it would allow scouts insightto their development. It will also alllow parents access to the scout's progress. 
It  would also allow communication within the troup. Adding mapping features and trip planning.

This was inspired more than 10 years ago when one of my newphews started scouts. the journey was exciting for him and cumbersome
for my sister. She had to remeber what he was exploring. He had to keep track of badges aquired and which were going to keep
him on track.
