SCOUT LOG 1.0
[License for ScoutLog](LICENSE)
### Inital Phase
Log in its inital phase is to help the scout master keep track of scouts and their badges. It allows an interactive 
use of an app between the scout master, the scout and the badges. Badges are easy to identify and collect by their look as well as their name. Scouts and their ranking are avaiable to review as well as addinig new scouts.

### Application 1.1 and beyond
Future implimentation includes adding requirements to each badge. As it expands, the app would allow scouts insight into their development. It will also allow parents access to the scout's progress. The app would also allow communication between scouts as well as within the troup orginization. additional features would include lat/long mapping features and trip planning.

### Why Scout Log
Inspiration for designing the app began more than 10 years ago when my newphew started scouts. The journey was exciting for him and cumbersome for my sister. She had to remember what he was exploring and making sure he completed the requirements. There are web-based app that require interaction with the web app. This app is mobile with ultimate conectivity to the offical Scout website. It will provide paperless documentation needed by Boy Scouts of America.

### Stories

Scout

This app is great. I can track how many badges I have earned and see which one I want to earn. I don’t have to carry by book all the time.  It lets me notify my scout master as well as my parents. I like being able to show my accomplishments.


Scout Master

As a scout master, this app will help me keep track of the scouts in my group. It will also allow me to keep track of each scout and their goals. There are reminders for reviews and it allows me to leave then stack of paperwork at home. I now have my scout information in my phone.


Parent

I love the convince of having the information about my scout on my phone. It is easy to maintain their goals without nagging them to find out what’s next.

### Instructions
